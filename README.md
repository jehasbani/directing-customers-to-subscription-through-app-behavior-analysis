Since marketing efforts cost money, companies need to know exactly who to target with offers and promotions.

In this case study, the targted audience are the people who use a company's free product (i.e. installed the company's free mobile app). The goal in this project is to predict which users will not subscribe to the paid membership, so that greater marketing efforts can go into trying to "convert" them to paid customers.
